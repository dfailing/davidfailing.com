This is a personal blog and professional portfolio, authored using R Markdown and R Studio, then built using Hugo and blogdown, and deployed to both GitHub and a DreamHost server using the version control features in RStudio. This readme will eventually have a collection of setup instructions, augmented by blog posts explaining how I tackled the stickier parts of the process, such as the deployment of my production site on DreamHost. For now, this repository is available as a source code resource and inspiration for others.
