      <description>&lt;p&gt;I spoke to math and computer science students about how my interdisciplinary undergraduate experience helped me have a better graduate school experience, and build a career as a mathematics faculty member.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Computer-Aided Investigation of Abstract Algebras (Or, The Computer Solved My Thesis Problem...)</title>
      <link>/talk/2013-03-21-mtcs/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract Algebra is the study of axiomatically defined structures arising from concrete objects, with the aim of establishing properties of those objects. Universal Algebra, loosely construed, is the study of axiom systems for their own sake (e.g. the theory of groups). With the help of automated reasoning tools like Prover9/Mace 4 and the Universal Algebra calculator, we may rapidly generate structures which satisfy a system of axioms, or make (and test) conjectures about the axioms. The talk will be particularly accessible to students currently enrolled in Math 200 and beyond, and possible topics for future undergraduate research will be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Affinely self-generating sets and substitution sequences</title>
      <link>/talk/2008-12-01-isu-seminar/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Kimberling defined a self-generating set $S$ of integers as follows: 1 is a member of $S$, and if $x$ is a member of $S$, then $2x$ and $4x - 1$ are in $S$. Nothing else is in $S$. As an REU project, I investigated several interesting properties of the Kimberling set, and its resulting sequences reduced modulo  m  - particularly the case  m  = 2, which yields the Fibonacci word. &lt;a href=&#34;https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/VOL10/Garth/garth14.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Garth and Gouge (2007)&lt;/a&gt; proved not only that any of a special class of affinely self-generating sets of integers reduced modulo $m$may be generated by a substitution morphism, but also its characteristic sequence, which turns out to be automatic. The talk will be introductory in nature, and will also discuss some of the open questions posed by Garth and Gouge.&lt;/p&gt;
