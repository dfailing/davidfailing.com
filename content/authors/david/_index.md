I have transitioned to consulting roles as a data scientist and educational content author, following six years as a tenure-track mathematics professor. Currently, I am a Data Science Educator at [RStudio](http://https://www.rstudio.com/), authoring educational content and mentoring small groups of novice R users in an accelerated, project based short-course format.

I also teach mathematics part-time at [Coconino Community College](https://www.coconino.edu/), and offer [private tutoring]({{< ref "/tutoring" >}}) in mathematics and statistics. 

My other passions include trail and ultra running, reading (public lands, conservation, and quirky fiction, among other topics), bicycling, and baking sourdough bread.

<!--I am also a PhD student in [Ecological and Environmental Informatics](https://ecoinfo.nau.edu/) at [Northern Arizona University](https://www.nau.edu), where I am a member of the [Paleoclimate Dynamics Lab](https://www.cefns.nau.edu/~npm4/). My current research involves environmental modeling of dust point sources related to land use and geomorphology.-->
