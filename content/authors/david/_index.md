A seasoned Data Science Leader, I have dedicated my career to advancing data-driven culture within organizations and leveraging data for actionable insights, strategic decision-making, and process optimization. Throughout my tenure, I have built and maintained robust analytics infrastructures, streamlined processes, and led teams towards operational efficiency.

Most recently, as Lead Data Scientist at [InsideTracker](https://www.insidetracker.com/), I managed the internal data science consultancy, facilitating seamless access to insights that drove marketing decisions, product innovation, and scientific advancement. In this capacity, I developed a custom R package for the team and assumed responsibility for a key RESTful API, among other initiatives. My emphasis on developing systematic processes, creating clear documentation, and establishing cohesive team standards was instrumental in ensuring the creation of outstanding, user-friendly, and standardized data products and reports.

Actively seeking opportunities, I am excited about roles that bridge the gap between coding and effective communication, particularly in data-driven, growth-oriented organizations. My background in higher education equipped me to excel at simplifying complex technical material, distilling it into digestible content for diverse audiences.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I am passionate about trail and ultra running, bicycling, bread baking, and reading on topics such as public lands, conservation, and quirky fiction. I believe these interests enrich my creative thinking and problem-solving skills, bringing a unique perspective to my data science work.

If youâ€™re looking for a Data Science Leader who can blend technical expertise with strategic insights, feel free to connect or send a message. I am open to discussing collaborations, job opportunities, or freelance work as a data science and analytics consultant.

I also teach mathematics part-time at [Coconino Community College](https://www.coconino.edu/), and offer [private tutoring]({{< ref "/tutoring" >}}) in mathematics and statistics.
