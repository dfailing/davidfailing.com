As Lead Data Scientist at [InsideTracker](https://www.insidetracker.com/), I managed the internal data science consultancy, facilitating seamless access to insights that drove marketing decisions, product innovation, and scientific advancement. I am seeking new roles that bridge the gap between coding and effective communication, particularly in data-driven, growth-oriented organizations. My background in higher education equipped me to excel at simplifying complex technical material, distilling it into digestible content for diverse audiences.

I'm passionate about trail and ultra running, bicycling, bread baking, and reading on topics such as public lands, conservation, and quirky fiction. I believe these interests enrich my creative thinking and problem-solving skills, bringing a unique perspective to my data science work.

If youâ€™re looking for a Data Science Leader who blends technical expertise with stellar communication, send an [email](mailto:david.failing@gmail.com). I am open to discussing collaborations, job opportunities, or freelance work as a data science and analytics consultant.

I also teach mathematics part-time at [Coconino Community College](https://www.coconino.edu/), and offer [private tutoring]({{< ref "/tutoring" >}}) in mathematics and statistics.
