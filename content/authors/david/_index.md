Following six years as a tenure-track mathematics professor, I am retraining as a data scientist. I work as a part-time faculty member in Mathematics at [Coconino Community College](https://www.coconino.edu/), and a PhD student in [Ecological and Environmental Informatics](https://ecoinfo.nau.edu/) at [Northern Arizona University](https://www.nau.edu), where I am a member of the [Paleoclimate Dynamics Lab](https://www.cefns.nau.edu/~npm4/). My current research involves environmental modeling of dust point sources related to land use and geomorphology. Outside of academia, my passions include reading (public lands, conservation, and quirky fiction, among other topics), trail and ultra running, bicycling, and cooking.
