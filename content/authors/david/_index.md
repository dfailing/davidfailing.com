I am Lead Data Scientist at [InsideTracker](https://www.insidetracker.com/), working with data from blood, DNA and wearables to derive insights that help our users live longer, healthier lives. I am open to freelance/consulting work as a data scientist or educational content author in mathematics and data science.

I also teach mathematics part-time at [Coconino Community College](https://www.coconino.edu/), and offer [private tutoring]({{< ref "/tutoring" >}}) in mathematics and statistics. 

My other passions include trail and ultra running, reading (public lands, conservation, and quirky fiction, among other topics), bicycling, and baking bread.
