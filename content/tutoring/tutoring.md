I hold a mathematics PhD, and have more than 15 years of experience in teaching and tutoring mathematics, statistics and data science courses at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels. I am available for private tutoring in Flagstaff or online (including for most mathematics courses at Coconino Community College and Northern Arizona University). I am also available to edit academic and technical documents. A partial list of courses at CCC and NAU that I can tutor is below, and you can also view lists of [courses I have taken]({{< ref "/courses" >}}) or [courses I have taught]({{< ref "/teaching" >}}). Contact me at david.failing@gmail.com to discuss rates, or if you need help for a course that is not listed here or at one of the above links.
