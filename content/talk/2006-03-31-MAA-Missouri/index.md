We generalize the result of Allouche, Shallit, and Skordev regarding the Kimberling sequence, defined by:
1) $1$ belongs to $S$;
2)  if the integer $x$ belongs to $S$, then $2x$ and $4x-1$ are also in $S$;
3)  nothing else is in $S$. Thus:

$$S = 1\  2\  3\  4\  6\  7\  8\  11\  12\  14\  15\  16\ldots$$

The set $T=S-1$, with its first term removed, is both the set of integers whose binary expansions contain no 00 block and the fixed point of the Fibonacci morphism $0\rightarrow01$, $1\rightarrow0$. We expand this result to the natural generalization of the Fibonacci morphism, of the form $0\rightarrow0^n1$, $1\rightarrow0$
