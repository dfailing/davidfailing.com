Join Scotty, Rachel Ingle and Kyle Gilman as we go on a road trip to MUDD territory and run at Veteran's Acres and do the first ever totally random sit down podcast in nature. We chat with Mike Farrington (about Squamish) and David Failing (about Math), as well as a whole host of other things in this expiramental and ground breaking show by everyday runners about everyday runners after having a everyday run.
