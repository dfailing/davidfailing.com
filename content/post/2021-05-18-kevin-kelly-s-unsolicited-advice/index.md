On the occasion of his [68th](https://kk.org/thetechnium/68-bits-of-unsolicited-advice/) and [69th](https://kk.org/thetechnium/99-additional-bits-of-unsolicited-advice/) birthdays, technologist Kevin Kelly posted compendia of his favorite "pithy bits of unsolicited advice," and I thought I'd call out my favorites from the two lists. Click through above to find your own favorites.

* "... learn from those you diagree with..."
* "... A deadline weeds out the extraneous and the ordinary. It prevents you from trying to make it perfect, so you have to make it different. Different is better."
* "While listening to someone you love keep asking them `Is there more?`, until there is no more."
* "Rule of 3 in conversation. To get to the real reason, ask a person to go deeper than what they just said. Then again, and once more. The third time's answer is close to the truth."
* "The more you are interested in others, the more interesting they find you. To be interesting, be interested."
* "... If you mess up, fess up. It's astounding how powerful this ownership is."
* "99% of success is just showing up."
* "When you die you take absolutely nothing with you except your reputation."
* "Acquiring things will rarely bring you deep satisfaction. But acquiring experiences will."
* "How to apologize: Quickly, specifically, sincerely."
* "It's not an apology if it comes with an excuse. It's not a compliment if it comes with a request."
* "In all things -- except love -- start with the exit strategy. Prepare for the ending. Almost anything is easier to get into than out of."
* "Train employees well enough they could get another job, but treat them well enough so they never want to."
* "Being wise means having more questions than answers."
* "Sustained outrage makes you stupid."
* "Your best response to an insult is `You're probably right.' Often they are."
* "If you borow something, try to return it in better shape than you received it. Clean it, sharpen it, fill it up."
* "Ignore what others may be thinking of you, because they aren't."
* "Always say less than necessary."
* "Don't treat people as bad as they are. Treat them as good as you are."
* "You can reduce the annoyance of someone's stupid belief by increasing your understanding of why they believe it."
* "If your goal does not have a schedule, it is a dream."
* "The greatest teacher is called `doing.`"
* "... `I have a rule for X` is the only excuse you need for your own personal policies. ..."
* "Don't let your email inbox become your to do list."
* "Advice like these are not laws. They are like hats. If one doesn't fit, try"
