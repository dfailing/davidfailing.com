I developed an application using R Shiny that displays results and course records for the Cry Me A River! Trail Runs. You can use the app [here](https://runphd.shinyapps.io/CMAR/).

The code and dataset needed to deploy the application are all in this repository. I update the raw results data every year after the race, generate the formatted CSV files to send to [UltraSignup](https://ultrasignup.com/), and submit them.
